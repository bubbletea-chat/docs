## Overview

### What is BubbleTea?

BubbleTea is a frontend platform that gives your AI agents and chatbots a home on the web. Think of it as the "user interface layer" for AI - where developers can instantly share their creations with the world through beautiful, accessible chat interfaces.

### üéØ Core Purpose

- **Instant web interface for any AI bot** - Get a professional chat UI without writing frontend code
- **Share bots via simple URLs** - Each bot gets its own public URL at `bubbletea.chat/your-bot-name`
- **Unified chat experience for users** - Consistent, polished interface across all bots
- **Conversation history & user dashboard** - Users can access all their chats in one place

### üí° Key Benefits

- **No frontend development needed** - Focus on your bot's logic, not UI code
- **Professional UI out of the box** - Mobile-friendly, accessible, and beautiful
- **Focus on AI logic, not UI code** - Build in any language, deploy anywhere
- **Built-in user management** - Authentication, sessions, and history handled for you

> **Note:** BubbleTea backend follows specific standards for bot integration. Check out the [Developer Tools](#developer-tools) section to learn about the API specifications and SDK.

These developer tools simplify the process of creating AI bots and agents that work perfectly with BubbleTea's chat interface. Build once, deploy anywhere, and let BubbleTea handle the user experience.

### üì¶ Python SDK

Build powerful AI bots with our feature-rich Python SDK.

#### üöÄ Quick Start

pip install bubbletea-chat

# Create your first bot
from bubbletea_chat import bt

@bt.chatbot
async def my_bot(message: str):
    yield bt.Text(f"You said: {message}")

# Run the bot (creates /chat endpoint automatically)
bt.run(my_bot, port=8000)
```

#### ü§ñ LLM Integration

```python
from bubbletea_chat import LLM

# Use any LLM provider
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4")
response = await llm.acomplete("Hello!")

# Stream responses
async for chunk in llm.stream("Tell me a story"):
    yield bt.Text(chunk)
```

#### üì∏ Vision & Media Support

```python
# Analyze images
@bt.chatbot
async def vision_bot(message: str, images: list = None):
    if images:
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4-vision-preview")
        response = await llm.acomplete_with_images(message, images)
        yield bt.Text(response)

# Generate images
image_url = await llm.agenerate_image("A sunset")
yield bt.Image(image_url)
